# Space Data Projects

Projects using Space data - Ideas and Work in progress

I'm considering the following projects:

 - **NASA Datasets information** - Create information about various NASA data sets, and links, descriptions for using them.
 
 -  **NASA Data Opportunities** - Create information and motivation for projects that could detect using NASS data:   
    - River pollution
    - Oil spill thickness analysis
    - Vegetation and crop extent
    - Crop type analysis
    - Plastic Pollution in the ocean

  
 - **UAVSAR Processed High Definition Images on a Website** - Making NASA SAR(UAVSAR) imagery available for analysis in a processed format.
   a) High resolution images of various landscapes, oceans, rivers, starting with one image as an example.
   b) Display RGB color model of the UAVSAR image using various polarizations as colours.
   c) Allow the raw data  HH, VV, VH or HV data to be displayed for specific pixels so they can be analysed.
 
 -  **Asteroid Modelling and Analysis** - Analyse and model forces on an asteroid taking into account light pressure / the Yarkovsky effect.

 -  **Impact Velocity Tool** - Simple tool to determining relative impact velocity given two 3D vectors.
   This can be useful given two objects in space and determining what the impact energy would be if the collided
   
 -  **Bolide (Meteor impact fireball) Data Analysis** - Do analysis of bolides to determine meteor events of interest and flag fireball events
   and meteors of interest.
