# Space Data Projects

## Updates

- Hyperspectral Imagery for Pollution Detection:
   - Worked more on file reading tools for Hyperspectral image file analysis - 2025/10/27
   - Investigated past attempts by groups at characterising plastic pollution from Space using remote sensing, and determining where could build on this and use newer technology - 2025/10/27
   - Got more ideaas for places to use as tests for detecting pollution from space (dump sites for exmample) in specific countries, ideally with street view to verify dump site. - 2025/10/27
   - Looked at ways of displaying a map of multispectral data showing certain channels as RGB - 2025/10/27
   - Investigated hyperspectral data sets in New York (USA) and Cape Town, South Africa. 2025/10

- Completed BETA version of NASA Impact event data (bolide) information and display a marker on Google Maps displaying date and time, location, altitude, impact energy(kt) and marker on Google Maps - 2025/10/28

- Worked on processing and analying SAR files - 2025/10/09
  
## Projects using Space data - Ideas and Work in progress

I'm considering the following projects:

 - **NASA Datasets information** - Create information about various NASA data sets, and links, descriptions for using them.
 
 -  **NASA Data Opportunities** - Create information and motivation for projects that could detect using NASA data:   
    - River pollution, including water quality (visual images and optional quantitative analysis)
    - Oil spill thickness analysis (visual images and optional quantitative analysis)
    - Vegetation and crop extent (visual images and optional quantitative analysis)
    - Crop type analysis (visual images and optional quantitative analysis)
    - Plastic Pollution in the ocean (visual images and optional quantitative analysis)

 - **UAVSAR Processed High Definition Images on a Website** - Making NASA SAR(UAVSAR) imagery available for analysis in a processed format.
   
    - High resolution images of various landscapes, oceans, rivers, starting with one image as an example.
    - Display RGB color model of the UAVSAR image using various polarizations as colours.
    - Allow the raw data  HH, VV, VH or HV data to be displayed for specific pixels so they can be analysed.
 
 -  **Asteroid Modelling and Analysis** - Analyse and model forces on an asteroid taking into account light pressure / the Yarkovsky effect.

 -  **Impact Velocity Tool** - Simple tool to determining relative impact velocity given two 3D vectors.
   This can be useful given two objects in space and determining what the impact energy would be if the collided
   
 -  **Bolide (Meteor impact fireball) Data Analysis** - Do analysis of bolides to determine meteor events of interest and flag fireball events
   and meteors of interest.
